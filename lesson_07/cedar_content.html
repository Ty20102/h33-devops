<h3>Cedar</h3>

<p>Cedar trees are large evergreen conifers with needle-like leaves arranged spirally on scented woody branches. They grow at high altitudes and thrive in full sun and well-draining soil. There are four species of cedar trees in the genus Cedrus, belonging to the pine (Pinaceae) family. Cedar trees are known for their durable, rot-resistant wood and distinctive aroma. They are used for construction, furniture-making, and landscaping. Cedar trees are also valued for their ornamental and medicinal properties. </p>

<p>There are four main species of true cedar:

Atlas cedar (Cedrus atlantica) – native to Morocco’s Atlas Mountains.

Cyprian cedar (Cedrus brevifolia) – found in Cyprus.

Himalayan cedar (Cedrus deodara) – known for its graceful, drooping branches.

Cedar of Lebanon (Cedrus libani) – historically revered and symbolically rich.</p>
